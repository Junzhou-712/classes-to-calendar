This is a web application and browser extension duo designed to take a UMN class schedule
and extract the class data out of it. The user can then add these classes to
their Google Calendar on either a new calendar or
an already existing one. They can also select the dates to add their classes to
their calendars.

## General Info

Currently, the dates default to the UMN Fall 2021 term, which
starts on **9/7/2021** and ends on **12/15/2021**.

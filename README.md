# Classes to Calendar

This is a web application designed to take an html file of a UMN class schedule
and extract the class data out of it. It uses BeatifulSoup to parse the text
from the html file into a calendar with the events being the classes. The user
can then add these classes to their Google Calendar on either a new calendar or
an already existing one. They can also select the dates to add their classes to
their calendars. Currently, the dates default to the UMN Fall 2020 term, which
starts on 9/8/2020 and ends on 12/16/2020.

# Classes to Calendar

This is a web application designed to take an html file of a UMN class schedule and extract the class data out of it. It uses BeatifulSoup to parse the text from the html file into a calendar with the events being the classes. The user can then add these classes to their Google Calendar on either a new calendar or an already existing one. Currently, it is hardcoded to start classes on 1/21/2020 and end on 5/4/2020.
